# AllLifeBank Personal Loan Campaign Modelling

Welcome to the AllLifeBank Personal Loan Campaign Modelling project! This project, part of the "Supervised Learning: Classification" course, aims to utilize the AllLifeBank dataset to build a predictive model. This model's goal is to assist the marketing department in identifying potential customers more likely to purchase a personal loan.

## Project Overview

The challenge is to leverage customer data to predict the likelihood of a customer purchasing a personal loan. This analysis and predictive model need to be accurate to allow AllLifeBank's marketing department to plan and target their campaigns effectively and efficiently.

### Objectives

1. **Data Analysis**: Conduct a thorough analysis of the AllLifeBank dataset, emphasizing factors that affect the likelihood of personal loan acceptance.

2. **Model Development**: Use classification algorithms to develop a predictive model that identifies potential loan customers from AllLifeBank's broader customer base.

3. **Strategic Insight**: Provide actionable strategic insight to the marketing department, using the model's findings to optimize campaign targeting and potentially improve acceptance rates for personal loan offers.

### Prerequisites

- Knowledge of supervised learning techniques, particularly classification algorithms.
- Software requirements: Python and associated libraries and packages (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn).
